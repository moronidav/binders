**Headline:** This Repo contains Jupyter Notebooks refactored into Binders for persistent, ephemeral operation and demonstration.

# TROPESS Binder Notebooks

This repo a curated set of [Binder-enabled](https://mybinder.org/) notebooks for portable, on-demand demonstration of open-source Jupyter Notebooks developed/co-developed authored/co-authored by [**David F. Moroni**](https://github.com/moronidav). 

Binder enables on-demand, repeatable execution of a Jupyter notebook that has been pre-configured within a [**JupyterHub**](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) server that is launchable from virtually any web browser (laptop | desktop | mobile device) from nearly anywhere in the world with an internet connection. These [Binder-enabled](https://mybinder.org/) notebooks are **NOT** intended for operational use or science-based decision-making, and are purely for **testing** and **demonstration** of the capabilities provided by each notebook.

These [Binder-enabled](https://mybinder.org/) notebooks are a work in progress and feature the following:
1. Data search/discovery
2. Data access/subset/extraction
3. Data plotting/analysis/visualization
4. Cloud-based operation
